# Internal Lectures

This project is for internal lectures at Solidware. In this lecture, we will use 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning.' [You can download the book here for free!](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) A Korean version of the book is available, but it is not free. [You can find it here.](http://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=10494492)

The major goal of this lecture is to deliver fundamental concepts of machine learning to our junior data scientists, junior machine learning scientists, and software engineers. We will stick with the book throughout our lectures expect for that Python will be used instead of R.
